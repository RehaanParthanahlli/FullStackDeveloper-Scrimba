transform — what it really is
transform visually changes an element without changing layout.

The browser does not recalculate surrounding elements.
That’s why it’s fast and preferred for motion.

What transform can do
1. translate() — move
transform: translate(50px, 20px);


Moves element without affecting others.

Variants:

translateX()

translateY()

2. scale() — resize
transform: scale(1.5);


Scales from the center by default.

3. rotate() — rotate
transform: rotate(45deg);


Rotates clockwise.

4. skew() — tilt
transform: skew(10deg, 5deg);


Tilts element.

Multiple transforms (IMPORTANT)
transform: translateX(100px) rotate(90deg) scale(1.2);


Order matters.
Left → right execution.





CSS ANIMATION — FULL PICTURE
What animation is

CSS animation = automatic change of CSS properties over time.

It does not need user interaction (unlike transition).

Animation exists because of two things only:

@keyframes

animation property

Nothing else is mandatory.

1. @keyframes — THE SCRIPT

Defines what changes over time.

Syntax:

@keyframes name {
  0%   { property: value; }
  50%  { property: value; }
  100% { property: value; }
}


Rules:

Name is user-defined

% = timeline

from = 0%

to = 100%

You can define any number of steps

You can animate:

transform

opacity

color

background-color

width / height

filter

etc.

You cannot animate:

display

position

float

2. animation — THE PLAYER

This applies the animation to an element.

Shorthand:

animation: name duration timing delay iteration direction fill playstate;


Example:

animation: spin 2s ease 0s infinite normal forwards running;

3. Every animation property (EXACTLY)
animation-name
animation-name: spin;


Which @keyframes to run.

animation-duration
animation-duration: 2s;


How long one cycle takes.

animation-timing-function
animation-timing-function: ease | linear | ease-in | ease-out | cubic-bezier();


Controls speed curve.

linear → constant speed

ease → default

cubic-bezier() → custom physics

animation-delay
animation-delay: 1s;


Wait before starting.

Can be negative → animation starts midway.

animation-iteration-count
animation-iteration-count: infinite | 1 | 5;


How many times it runs.

animation-direction
animation-direction: normal | reverse | alternate | alternate-reverse;


alternate → forward, then backward

Prevents snapping back

animation-fill-mode
animation-fill-mode: none | forwards | backwards | both;


Controls what state stays visible.

forwards → keep last frame

backwards → apply first frame during delay

both → both rules

This is where most beginners fail.

animation-play-state
animation-play-state: running | paused;


Used to pause/play animations via hover or JS.

4. Multiple animations (advanced)
animation:
  spin 2s linear infinite,
  fade 1s ease forwards;


Yes — multiple animations on one element.

5. Animation vs Transition (FINAL)
Feature	Transition	Animation
Needs trigger	YES	NO
Runs automatically	NO	YES
Multiple steps	NO	YES
Loop	NO	YES
6. Performance truth (important)

Best properties to animate:

transform

opacity

Avoid animating:

top, left

width, height (heavy)

margin (layout reflow)

7. Mental model (lock this forever)

@keyframes → timeline

animation → engine

transform / opacity → fuel

Animation does not depend on transform.
Transform is just the cleanest fuel.
